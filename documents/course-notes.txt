We do not use classes, only functional components (modern way of working in React).
What makes JS function a React component is that it returns JSX code or React.create element logic.
Your components can be used in JSX only the name must start with a capital letter.

All css files are applied globally no matter where you import them.
We transfer properties between React components using 'props'.
Every js object has to be mapped into a JSX equivalent (renderable element).

Callback functions naming convention: 'onXY' (eg. 'onAddGoal').

When a JS object is changed React ignores it, we need to notify it to rerender - with a hook function.
Hook functions (functional React) start with 'use' prefix (eg. 'useState').

useState always returns two elements:
 - latest snapshot,
 - a function that allows us to update that state
